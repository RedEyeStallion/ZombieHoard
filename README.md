# ZombieHoard

ZombieHoard was a simple school team project in which zombies randomly spawn at one of four starting locations 
and try to make it to the player's base using waypoints and the Breadth First Search algorithm. Meanwhile, 
the player can move a soldier around on screen and place bombs to try and stop the zombies from making it to
his base. If any zombie reaches his base, it's Game Over!
